# Dengue Trends
Visualization of the rate of dengue fever in Indonesia over a 14-year time span using d3. 
This is an exploratory visualization (read: I'm learning d3!) with the goal of increasing dengue awareness/education, particularly for travelers to countries with high incidents of dengue. 
Work in progress.
